# NeuroSynth-Enhancing-Cognitive-computing
NEUROSYNTH addresses the challenges of natural language understanding (NLU) by offering an advanced framework for cognitive computing using deep neural networks. It combines data preprocessing, advanced word embeddings, and cutting-edge question answering systems to set a new benchmark for NLU research. The system consists of a text complexity analyzer, which preprocesses text inputs through readability metrics and linguistic analysis, a feature engineering module that leverages embeddings like GloVe and RoBERTa, and a custom question answering model trained on the SQuAD dataset to deliver high performance in extracting answers from complex contexts.
